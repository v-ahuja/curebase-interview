# Interview

During the coding interview we would like you to create a simple but complete full stack application, using any and all AI tools you want to use in your favorite environment. The application will collect information from the user and store it in a database, and filter the data.

It will have to be in our preferred stack:

React, Typescript, Node, NextJS, Tailwind, relational DB (PostgreSQL preferred), Docker

Please arrive with all your tools ready to go. You will drive and share your screen, we will observe and question/guide where needed. At the beginning of the interview, we will provide the concrete application to build - it will be a fairly basic application to capture user input, store it, filter output.

AI generated code is explicitly encouraged. We encourage you to try this with your tool chain before the interview and produce a working full stack application.

Evaluation: We donâ€™t just want you to generate a working system, we want you to explain how it works and refine it using best practices and make it a solution that is elegant, maintainable and extendable. In short, create an application you would be proud of. The kind of application you would give to a coworker (with an anger management issue) to maintain.
